# onion-crawler

A Rust program that extracts `.onion` addresses from [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) WARC archives.

This project is also a **hands-on Rust tutorial** — each step introduces new language concepts with well-commented code and a learning journal (`PROGRESS.md`) explaining the reasoning behind every pattern used.

## Purpose

Common Crawl provides petabytes of web archive data stored as WARC (Web ARChive) files. This tool downloads those archives, parses them, and extracts any `.onion` (Tor hidden service) addresses found in the crawled content.

## Features

The project was built incrementally, one feature per step:

1. **Read WARC paths** — Parse an input file listing WARC archive URIs
2. **HTTP download** — Fetch WARC archives from Common Crawl servers
3. **WARC parsing** — Decompress gzip-compressed archives and parse WARC records
4. **Onion extraction** — Use regex to find `.onion` addresses in page content
5. **Deduplication & output** — Deduplicate results and produce structured JSON output
6. **Concurrent processing** — Download and parse multiple archives in parallel with async/tokio

## Rust Concepts Covered

Each step introduces new Rust fundamentals:

- Error handling with `Result` and `Option`
- Buffered I/O and iterators
- Pattern matching
- Adding and using external crates
- Async programming with `tokio`
- Regex and string processing
- Concurrency patterns

See `[PROGRESS.md](documentation/PROGRESS.md)` for detailed explanations of each concept as they are introduced.

## Build & Run

Requires Rust 1.91+ (edition 2024).

```sh
cargo build              # compile (debug)
cargo build --release    # compile (optimized — ~16s per 1GB archive)
cargo run                # download & parse all archives
cargo run -- --limit 3   # process up to 3 archives
cargo run -- --jobs 2    # 2 concurrent downloads (default: CPU cores)
cargo run -- --delete    # delete archive after parsing
cargo run -- --limit 3 --jobs 2 --delete custom.paths  # combined
```
