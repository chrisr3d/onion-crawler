## Step 1: Project Scaffolding — Read WARC Paths File

### What we built

A minimal Rust binary that reads a file of WARC archive paths (one per line) and prints
each path with its line number. Accepts any path file as a CLI argument, defaulting to
`warc.paths`. This is the foundation that all subsequent steps build on.

### Rust concepts introduced

**`std::env::args()` — CLI argument parsing**
Returns an iterator over the command-line arguments passed to the program. Index 0 is
the program name, index 1 is the first user argument. We use `.nth(1)` to grab it as
an `Option<String>`, then `unwrap_or_else` to provide a default value.

**`Result<T, E>` — Error handling without exceptions**
Rust has no exceptions. Functions that can fail return `Result`, which is either `Ok(value)`
or `Err(error)`. `File::open` returns `Result<File, io::Error>`. We handle the error case
explicitly with `unwrap_or_else`, printing to stderr and exiting with a non-zero code.

**`BufReader` — Buffered I/O**
Reading a file byte-by-byte (or line-by-line without buffering) triggers a system call per
read. `BufReader` wraps a `File` with an 8 KB in-memory buffer, so the OS reads in large
chunks and our code consumes from the buffer. Same result, far fewer syscalls.

**`.lines().enumerate()` — Iterator composition**
`.lines()` on a `BufReader` returns an iterator that lazily yields one `Result<String>` per
line. `.enumerate()` wraps each item as `(index, value)`. No vector is allocated — lines
are processed one at a time (this is what Rust calls a "zero-cost abstraction").

**`match` — Pattern matching**
Rust's `match` is an exhaustive pattern-matching expression. The compiler ensures every
variant is handled. We match on `Ok(line)` and `Err(err)` to process good lines and
report bad ones without crashing.

**`println!` vs `eprintln!` — stdout vs stderr**
`println!` writes to stdout (the data stream). `eprintln!` writes to stderr (diagnostics).
This separation matters when piping: `cargo run | head -5` shows only paths, not the
summary line.

**`{:>4}` — Format specifiers**
Rust's formatting mini-language in `println!` supports alignment and width. `{:>4}` means
"right-align in a 4-character field", producing neatly columned output like `   1 | ...`.

### What's next

Step 2: Download WARC archives over HTTP.

---

## Step 2: HTTP Download of WARC Archives

### What we built

An HTTP downloader that fetches Common Crawl WARC archives to a local `download/` directory.
Each URI from `warc.paths` is prepended with `https://data.commoncrawl.org/` to form the
full URL. Archives are streamed to disk (never fully loaded into memory), already-downloaded
files are skipped, and a `--limit N` flag caps how many files to fetch per run.

### Rust concepts introduced

**External crates (`Cargo.toml` dependencies)**
Rust's package manager Cargo resolves dependencies declared in `Cargo.toml`. Adding
`ureq = "3"` pulls the `ureq` HTTP client and all its transitive dependencies. We chose
`ureq` over `reqwest` because it's blocking-only with minimal dependencies — no hidden
async runtime. This keeps the code simple while we learn fundamentals.

**`Box<dyn Error>` — trait objects for error handling**
`Box<dyn Error>` is a heap-allocated pointer to *any* type implementing the `Error` trait.
This lets a function return different error types (io::Error, ureq::Error, etc.) through
a single return type. The caller doesn't need to know the concrete type — it can still
print the error message via the `Display` trait.

**The `?` operator — early return on error**
`?` is syntactic sugar for: "if this Result is Err, return the error from the current
function; otherwise, unwrap the Ok value." It replaces verbose `match` blocks and makes
error propagation concise. It also automatically converts error types when the function
returns `Box<dyn Error>`.

**`Path` / `PathBuf` — cross-platform file paths**
`Path` is a borrowed path slice (like `&str`), `PathBuf` is the owned version (like
`String`). `.join()` appends path components with the correct OS separator. Unlike raw
strings, these types handle platform differences (e.g., `/` vs `\`) correctly.

**`fs::create_dir_all` — idempotent directory creation**
Like `mkdir -p` in Unix: creates the directory and all parents if needed, silently
succeeds if the directory already exists. Idempotent operations like this are great for
robustness — the program works whether it's the first run or the hundredth.

**`File::create` vs `File::open`**
`File::open` opens a file for reading. `File::create` opens for writing, creating the
file if it doesn't exist or truncating it if it does. Two separate functions make the
intent explicit at the call site.

**`impl Trait` in function parameters**
`fn download_with_progress(reader: impl Read, writer: impl Write, ...)` accepts *any*
type implementing `Read` or `Write`. This is compile-time polymorphism — the compiler
generates specialized code for each concrete type used. It's Rust's equivalent of
generics with trait bounds, written in a more readable form.

**`Read` / `Write` traits — streaming I/O**
The `Read` trait provides `.read(&mut buf)` for pulling bytes from a source. The `Write`
trait provides `.write_all(&buf)` for pushing bytes to a destination. By programming
against traits (not concrete types), our download function works with files, network
streams, or in-memory buffers.

**`.take(n)` on iterators — lazy limiting**
`.take(n)` wraps an iterator so it yields at most `n` items, then stops. It's lazy —
it doesn't collect or allocate, just stops pulling from the inner iterator. We use it
to cap downloads: `.lines().filter(...).take(limit)`.

**`str::parse::<T>()` — parsing strings into typed values**
The turbofish syntax `::<usize>` tells the compiler what type to parse into. `.parse()`
returns `Result<T, ParseError>`, so invalid input is caught at runtime without panicking.

**Borrow checker and temporary lifetimes**
When chaining method calls like `.into_body().with_config().reader()`, each intermediate
value must live long enough for the next call to borrow from it. We split the chain into
separate `let` bindings so the borrow checker can verify that each reference is valid.
This is a common Rust pattern — explicit bindings make lifetimes clear.

### What's next

Step 3: Decompress the downloaded `.warc.gz` files and parse WARC records to extract
their content for further processing.

---

## Steps 3–5: WARC Parsing, .onion Extraction, and Deduplication

### What we built

A complete processing pipeline that decompresses WARC archives, scans for `.onion`
addresses using regex, deduplicates results, and persists them to JSON. The program now
implements a three-state model for each archive:

1. **Already processed** (in `output/processed.log`) → skip entirely
2. **Downloaded but not parsed** (file exists in `download/`) → parse it
3. **Not downloaded** → download first, then parse

Results are stored in `output/onions.json` as a map from each `.onion` address to the
list of archives it was found in. A `--delete` flag optionally removes archives after
parsing to save disk space.

### Rust concepts introduced

**`HashMap<K, V>` — key-value hash table**
Rust's standard hash map provides O(1) average-case lookup and insertion. We use
`HashMap<String, Vec<String>>` to map each `.onion` address to its source archives.
The `entry().or_default()` pattern is the idiomatic way to do "get-or-insert" — it
avoids a double lookup (one to check existence, one to insert).

**`HashSet<T>` — unique membership collection**
`HashSet` stores unique values with O(1) average-case lookup via hashing. We use it
in two places: to track already-processed filenames (skip-if-processed logic), and for
per-archive deduplication of `.onion` addresses during parsing.

**The `warc` crate — structured WARC parsing**
Instead of raw byte scanning with `flate2` + `read_until`, we use the `warc` crate
which understands the WARC archive format. `WarcReader::from_path_gzip` handles gzip
decompression internally and parses record boundaries, headers, and bodies. Each record
is yielded as a typed struct with a `warc_type()` (Response, Request, Metadata, etc.)
and a `body()` payload. By filtering to only `RecordType::Response`, we skip binary
content, request records, and metadata — processing ~30–50% of the data instead of 100%.

**`RecordType` enum — WARC record types**
WARC records are typed: Response (HTTP response bodies), Request (HTTP requests),
Metadata, WarcInfo, etc. Only Response records contain the HTML/JS content where
`.onion` links appear. Pattern matching on the enum lets us skip everything else.

**Why structured parsing beats raw scanning**
The previous approach decompressed every byte and scanned it through regex — including
binary content (images, fonts) that produced multi-megabyte "lines" with no newlines.
Working at the right abstraction level (WARC records instead of raw bytes) is a general
performance lesson: when data has structure, use it.

**`Regex` compilation and `find_iter` — pattern matching**
`Regex::new()` compiles a pattern string into an efficient automaton. This compilation
is expensive, so we do it once outside the loop. `find_iter()` returns an iterator of
all non-overlapping matches in a string, which we use to scan each line for `.onion`
patterns. Our regex matches both v2 (16-char) and v3 (56-char) onion addresses using
base32 character classes.

**`serde_json` — JSON serialization without derive macros**
`serde_json::to_string_pretty` serializes any type that implements serde's `Serialize`
trait. Standard library types like `HashMap`, `Vec`, and `String` get this automatically
through blanket implementations — no `#[derive(Serialize)]` needed.

**`OpenOptions` — fine-grained file opening**
Unlike `File::create` (which truncates) or `File::open` (read-only), `OpenOptions`
lets us combine flags: `.append(true)` positions writes at the end (like `>>` in shell),
`.create(true)` creates the file if it doesn't exist. We use this for the processed log
so we never lose previously logged entries.

**`Cow<str>` via `String::from_utf8_lossy` — zero-cost when possible**
`from_utf8_lossy` returns `Cow<str>` (Copy-on-Write). If the input bytes are valid
UTF-8 (the common case), it borrows the original data with no allocation. If bytes
contain invalid sequences, it allocates a new String with U+FFFD replacement characters.
We use this to convert WARC response bodies (which are `&[u8]`) to strings for regex
scanning.

### Correctness fixes applied later

**Duplicate archive names in results** — The original `results.entry(onion).or_default().push()`
blindly appended the archive filename. If an archive was reprocessed (interrupted run, manual
re-run), the same filename would appear multiple times. Fixed with `Vec::contains` before
inserting. We chose `Vec::contains` (linear scan) over `HashSet` because the lists are tiny
(1–5 entries per onion) — for small N, a linear scan beats the hashing overhead, and `Vec`
preserves insertion order for stable JSON output.

**Incremental result persistence** — Originally, `save_results` ran once after the loop while
`mark_processed` ran per-archive. A crash between the two could cause results and processed
state to diverge. Now both run per-archive: if either fails, the next run reprocesses that
archive (safe, just redundant). The final `save_results` after the loop remains as a safety
net. This "save after each unit of work" pattern is standard for batch jobs where interruption
is expected.

### What's next

Performance optimization: benchmark and fix regex performance, optimize debug builds.

---

## Performance Fixes

### Root cause: catastrophic regex performance with `(?i)` flag

The crawler was taking ~2.5 minutes (release) to parse a 1GB WARC archive, while the
old crawler did it in ~17 seconds. Isolating the bottleneck via a minimal benchmark
revealed that WARC parsing + gzip decompression takes only ~15s — the entire slowdown
was in the regex.

The original regex `(?i)\b[a-z2-7]{16}\.onion\b|\b[a-z2-7]{56}\.onion\b` used the
case-insensitive `(?i)` flag. When combined with `\b` (word boundary assertions), this
forces the `regex` crate off its fast DFA (deterministic finite automaton) path into a
much slower execution mode. The engine can no longer use literal prefix optimizations
(scanning for `.onion` as a fixed string) and must evaluate the full automaton at every
byte position across 4.5GB of decompressed text.

The fix was switching to the old crawler's pattern: `\b([a-z2-7]{16}|[a-z2-7]{56})\.onion\b`
(case-sensitive). Since `.onion` addresses are base32 and conventionally lowercase, and
our code already calls `.to_lowercase()` on matches, case-insensitive matching was
unnecessary. This regex is **1,250x faster** on the same data.

| Regex | Time (4.5GB text, release) |
|---|---|
| `(?i)\b[a-z2-7]{16}\.onion\b\|\b[a-z2-7]{56}\.onion\b` | 125.6s |
| `\b([a-z2-7]{16}\|[a-z2-7]{56})\.onion\b` | 0.1s |

**Lesson: regex performance is not intuitive.** Small flag changes (`(?i)`) can cause
orders-of-magnitude slowdowns depending on how the regex engine optimizes internally.
When performance matters, benchmark the actual regex against real data. The `regex` crate
has excellent documentation on its optimization strategies in the
[`regex` crate docs](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#performance).

### Optimized dependency compilation in debug mode

Even with the fast regex, debug builds are slower because dependency code (gzip
decompression, regex automaton, WARC parsing) runs without optimization. The standard
Rust fix is to optimize dependencies at `-O2` while keeping our own code in debug mode:

```toml
[profile.dev.package."*"]
opt-level = 2
```

**`[profile.dev.package."*"]` — per-package profile overrides**
Cargo allows overriding compiler optimization levels on a per-package basis within a
profile. `dev` is the profile used by `cargo build` and `cargo run`. `package."*"` is a
wildcard matching all dependency crates (but not our own crate). `opt-level = 2` is the
same optimization level used by the `release` profile. This gives us the best of both
worlds: fast dependency code + debuggable application code.

Final measured results on a 1GB WARC archive (~30,000 records, ~15,000 responses):
- **Release build**: ~16s (matching old crawler's ~17s)
- **Debug build with `opt-level = 2` on deps**: ~1m 20s
- **Debug build without optimization**: would be significantly slower

### What's next

Step 6: Concurrent downloads and processing with async/tokio.

---

## Step 6: Concurrent Downloads & Processing with Tokio

### What we built

A concurrent processing pipeline that downloads and parses multiple WARC archives in
parallel. The sequential bottleneck (download 1 → parse 1 → download 2 → parse 2) is
replaced with a pipeline where up to N archives download simultaneously, and parsing
starts immediately when each download completes. A `--jobs N` flag controls the
concurrency level and `--limit N` caps the number of archives to process.

Key architectural changes:
- Replaced `ureq` (blocking HTTP) with `reqwest` (async HTTP with Tokio)
- `main` is now `async fn main()` driven by the Tokio multi-threaded runtime
- Downloads use async I/O — threads are released during network waits
- WARC parsing (CPU-bound) runs on Tokio's blocking thread pool via `spawn_blocking`
- `futures::stream::buffer_unordered` provides bounded concurrency
- `Arc<Regex>` shares the compiled regex across concurrent tasks

### Rust concepts introduced

**`async`/`await` — cooperative multitasking**
Async functions return `Future`s — values that represent incomplete computation. When
you `.await` a future, the current task *suspends* and yields control back to the
runtime, which can then run other tasks on the same thread. This is cooperative
multitasking: tasks voluntarily give up the thread at `.await` points, unlike OS threads
where the scheduler preempts them. The key benefit: thousands of concurrent I/O operations
can share just a few OS threads, because most are waiting for network/disk, not using CPU.

**Tokio runtime — the async executor**
Async code doesn't run by itself — it needs an *executor* to poll futures to completion.
`#[tokio::main]` sets up a multi-threaded Tokio runtime (one worker thread per CPU core
by default) and drives our `async fn main()` on it. The runtime manages task scheduling,
I/O event notification (via `epoll`/`kqueue`), and timer events. It's the engine that
makes `.await` actually work.

**`spawn_blocking` — bridging sync and async worlds**
Not everything can (or should) be async. The `warc` crate is synchronous and does
CPU-heavy work (gzip decompression + parsing). Running this directly on an async worker
thread would block it, starving other async tasks. `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` moves
the work to a separate thread pool designed for blocking operations. The async task
suspends at `.await` until the blocking work completes, keeping the async threads free.
Rule of thumb: if a function does CPU work or blocking I/O for more than a few
microseconds, use `spawn_blocking`.

**`reqwest` — async HTTP streaming**
`reqwest` is Tokio-native: its `.send().await` releases the thread during the entire
HTTP request/response cycle. The response body is consumed chunk-by-chunk with
`.chunk().await`, where each `.await` releases the thread during network waits. Compare
with `ureq` where the thread sits blocked during the entire transfer. For concurrent
downloads, async means 4 downloads sharing 1 thread vs. 4 downloads needing 4 blocked
threads.

**`buffer_unordered(N)` — bounded concurrent stream processing**
`futures::stream::buffer_unordered(N)` is a stream combinator that polls up to N futures
simultaneously, yielding results as each completes (not in submission order). When one
finishes, the next pending future starts. This gives us bounded concurrency without
manual semaphore management. "Unordered" is key: a fast download isn't held up waiting
for a slow one just because the slow one started first.

**`Arc<T>` — atomic reference counting for shared ownership**
Each concurrent task needs access to the compiled regex and HTTP client. Normal references
(`&Regex`) won't work because Tokio tasks require `'static` lifetimes (they could outlive
the spawning scope). `Arc` (Atomic Reference Count) wraps a value in a thread-safe smart
pointer: `Arc::clone()` is cheap (just increments an atomic counter), and the inner value
is dropped when the last `Arc` goes away. `Arc` provides shared *immutable* access — for
shared mutable state you'd combine it with a `Mutex` (`Arc<Mutex<T>>`), but we avoid that
by merging results sequentially on the main task.

**`pin_mut!` — pinning streams for polling**
Async streams must be "pinned" (guaranteed not to move in memory) before they can be
polled. `futures::pin_mut!` pins a value to the stack. This is a detail of Rust's async
model: because futures are state machines that contain self-references, moving them after
creation would invalidate those references. Pinning is the compiler's guarantee that this
won't happen.

**Concurrent work, sequential merging**
The pipeline is concurrent for downloads and parsing, but result merging (updating the
HashMap, writing files) is sequential on the main task. This avoids locks and race
conditions entirely — the simplest correct approach. This is a common async pattern:
fan out for independent work, fan in for shared state updates.

### Dependencies changed

- **Removed `ureq`**: blocking HTTP client, replaced by async `reqwest`
- **Added `reqwest`**: async HTTP client native to Tokio, with streaming body support
- **Added `tokio`**: the async runtime (multi-threaded executor, async I/O, timers,
  blocking thread pool). Features: `rt-multi-thread`, `macros`, `fs`, `sync`
- **Added `futures`**: stream utilities (`StreamExt`, `pin_mut!`, `buffer_unordered`)
  that complement Tokio's core functionality

---

## Additional Improvements

### Smarter defaults for `--jobs` and `--limit`

**Auto-detect CPU cores for `--jobs`** — The initial default of 4 concurrent jobs was
an arbitrary constant. Replaced with `std::thread::available_parallelism()`, which
queries the OS for the number of logical CPUs (hardware threads). The program now
scales to the machine it runs on: a 16-core server uses 16 jobs, a 4-core laptop
uses 4. Falls back to 1 if detection fails (e.g. constrained containers).

**`std::thread::available_parallelism()` — runtime hardware detection**
Returns `Result<NonZeroUsize>` — a safe, non-panicking query with no side effects.
It's the standard library's replacement for the `num_cpus` crate (stable since Rust
1.59). `NonZeroUsize` guarantees the value is at least 1, and `.get()` converts it
to a plain `usize`.

**Remove processing limit** — The initial default of `--limit 1` meant the program
only processed one archive per run unless explicitly overridden. Changed to unlimited
by default (internally `limit = 0`, with the limit check guarded by `limit > 0`).
The program now processes all unprocessed URIs in the paths file, which is the
expected behavior for a batch processing tool. `--limit N` remains available for
testing or resource-constrained runs.

### Per-archive timing instrumentation

Added wall-clock timing for each archive's download and parse phases using
`std::time::Instant`. Each archive now reports its download time and parse time
individually. The final summary includes average download and parse times across
all processed archives, giving visibility into where time is spent.

**`std::time::Instant` — monotonic clock for benchmarking**
`Instant::now()` captures a point in time. `start.elapsed()` returns a `Duration`
representing the wall-clock time since that instant. Unlike system clocks,
`Instant` is monotonic — it never goes backwards (e.g. due to NTP adjustments),
making it safe for measuring elapsed time. `Duration::as_secs_f64()` converts
to a floating-point seconds value for display.

### Portable TLS with `rustls`

The default `reqwest` configuration uses OpenSSL for TLS, which requires system
packages (`libssl-dev`, `pkg-config`) that may not be present on minimal Linux
installations or Docker images. Switched to `rustls` — a pure-Rust TLS implementation:

```toml
reqwest = { version = "0.12", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls"] }
```

This eliminates the system dependency entirely. The binary compiles on any platform
with just the Rust toolchain, consistent with the project's portability goal.

---

## Post-1.0.0: CLI, Gzip Paths, and Code Structure

### `clap` derive for CLI argument parsing

Replaced the hand-rolled `while` loop argument parser (~50 lines of repetitive
`strip_prefix` / `==` checks) with `clap`'s derive macro. The entire CLI definition
is now a struct with attributes:

```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "onion-crawler")]
#[command(about = "Extract .onion addresses from Common Crawl WARC archives")]
struct Config {
    /// Path to the WARC-paths file (supports .gz)
    input: String,

    /// Maximum number of archives to process (default: all)
    #[arg(short, long)]
    limit: Option<usize>,

    /// Number of concurrent download+parse tasks
    #[arg(short, long, default_value_t = default_jobs())]
    jobs: usize,

    /// Delete archive files after parsing
    #[arg(short, long)]
    delete: bool,
}
```

### Rust concepts introduced

**`clap` derive macro — declarative CLI definitions**
`#[derive(Parser)]` generates all argument parsing code from the struct definition.
Each field becomes a CLI argument: positional fields (no `#[arg]` with `short`/`long`)
are positional arguments, fields with `#[arg(short, long)]` become flags. `clap`
handles `--flag value`, `--flag=value`, `-f value`, type parsing, error messages,
and `--help` generation automatically.

**`///` doc comments as help text**
`clap` turns doc comments (`///`) on struct fields into the `--help` descriptions.
This is why the struct-level explanation uses regular comments (`//`) instead —
otherwise `clap` would include those in the help banner too. The `#[command(about)]`
attribute explicitly sets the one-line program description shown in `--help`.

**`Option<usize>` for optional arguments**
`limit` is `Option<usize>` instead of the previous `usize` with 0-means-unlimited.
`Option` is Rust's way of expressing "this value may or may not be present" — it's
either `Some(value)` or `None`. This is more expressive than sentinel values (0, -1)
because the type itself encodes the possibility of absence.

**`if let Some(x)` — pattern matching on `Option`**
To check and extract an `Option` value in one step:
```rust
if let Some(limit) = config.limit {
    if work_items.len() >= limit { break; }
}
```
`if let` tries to match the right side against the pattern on the left. If
`config.limit` is `Some(5)`, the pattern matches and `limit` is bound to `5` as
a new local variable scoped to the block. If it's `None`, the block is skipped.
This replaces the previous `if config.limit > 0 && ...` guard. The variable `limit`
doesn't exist before this line — it's created by the pattern match, similar to how
function parameters are created from passed arguments.

**Required positional argument**
The input paths file changed from a hardcoded default (`"warc.paths"`) to a required
positional argument. With `clap`, a `String` field without `default_value` is required —
running the program without it shows a clear error message. This is better for
explicitness: the user always knows which file is being processed.

### Gzip-compressed paths file support

Common Crawl distributes `warc.paths.gz` files. Rather than requiring manual
decompression, the program now detects `.gz` extensions and decompresses transparently:

```rust
let reader: Box<dyn BufRead> = if config.input.ends_with(".gz") {
    let decoder = libflate::gzip::Decoder::new(file)?;
    Box::new(BufReader::new(decoder))
} else {
    Box::new(BufReader::new(file))
};
```

**`Box<dyn BufRead>` — trait objects for runtime polymorphism**
The two branches return different concrete types (`BufReader<Decoder<File>>` vs
`BufReader<File>`), but both implement `BufRead`. `Box<dyn BufRead>` is a trait
object — a heap-allocated pointer to *any* type implementing `BufRead`. This lets
us assign either branch to the same variable. The `dyn` keyword means "dynamic
dispatch": method calls go through a vtable (function pointer table) at runtime,
unlike generic code which is resolved at compile time. The tiny runtime cost is
irrelevant here since we read the paths file once at startup.

**Reusing transitive dependencies**
`libflate` was already compiled as a transitive dependency of the `warc` crate.
Adding `libflate = "1"` to `Cargo.toml` just makes it directly importable — no
new download or compilation needed. This is a practical Rust tip: check `cargo tree`
before adding a new crate — the functionality you need might already be in the
dependency tree.

### Binary + library crate structure

Split the single `main.rs` into two files:
- **`src/main.rs`** — CLI parsing with `clap` and pipeline orchestration (the coordinator)
- **`src/lib.rs`** — all feature code: download, WARC parsing, state management

**Why this structure?**
Rust supports having both a binary (`main.rs`) and a library (`lib.rs`) in the same
package. The binary is the executable entry point; the library holds reusable code.
`main.rs` imports from the library using the crate name: `use onion_crawler::{...}`.
This separation makes the code easier to navigate — the coordinator logic is separate
from the feature implementations — and the library code could be reused by other
binaries or tests.

**`pub` visibility**
Functions and constants in `lib.rs` that `main.rs` needs must be marked `pub` (public).
By default, items in Rust are private to their module. `pub` makes them accessible from
outside the crate. This is Rust's encapsulation: the library controls exactly what it
exposes.

## Step 7: Ripgrep-Style Parsing Strategies

### What we built

Four progressively optimized parsing strategies inspired by how ripgrep achieves its
speed, selectable at runtime via `-s` / `--strategy`. Each strategy produces identical
results but uses different techniques, so they can be benchmarked against each other on
the same archive. The default strategy (`memchr`) processes an 864MB archive in ~5.6s
— down from ~16s with the baseline.

| Strategy | Parser | Search | Performance |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `baseline` | `warc` crate | `regex::Regex` on UTF-8 `String` | ~16s/GB |
| `bytes` | Custom streaming | `regex::bytes::Regex` on `&[u8]` | ~1.5-2x faster |
| `memchr` | Custom streaming | SIMD `memmem` literal search | ~3-5x faster |
| `mmap` | Custom slice (mmap) | SIMD `memmem` + zero-copy bodies | ~3-6x faster |

Two new modules were added:
- **`src/warc_parser.rs`** — Custom byte-level WARC parser (streaming + mmap slice)
- **`src/onion_search.rs`** — Onion extraction strategies (regex-bytes, memchr)

### Rust concepts introduced

**`regex::bytes::Regex` — searching raw bytes without UTF-8 conversion**
The `regex` crate has two modules most people don't know about: `regex::Regex` searches
`&str` (requires valid UTF-8), while `regex::bytes::Regex` searches `&[u8]` (arbitrary
bytes). ripgrep uses `regex::bytes` exclusively because real-world files contain invalid
UTF-8. By searching `&[u8]` directly, the `bytes` strategy eliminates the
`String::from_utf8_lossy()` allocation that the baseline makes for every record body —
instead of converting hundreds of KB per record to a `String`, we search the raw bytes
and only convert the 22-62 byte match.

**`memchr::memmem::Finder` — SIMD-accelerated literal search**
The core technique behind ripgrep's speed. `memmem::Finder::new(b".onion")` compiles a
SIMD-accelerated searcher that scans bytes at 16-32 bytes per CPU cycle (SSE2/AVX2 on
x86_64, NEON on ARM). Instead of running the regex NFA/DFA engine on every byte of every
record body, we jump directly to `.onion` occurrences and validate the surrounding bytes
with cheap comparisons. Since `.onion` is rare in typical web content (0-2 matches per
50-500 KB body), the validator almost never runs.

This is ripgrep's key insight applied: **extract literal substrings from the regex
pattern, use SIMD to find candidates, then validate only those positions.** Our pattern
`\b[a-z2-7]{16,56}\.onion\b` has the fixed literal `.onion`, making it a perfect
candidate for this optimization.

**`#[inline(always)]` — controlling function inlining**
For tiny predicate functions like `is_onion_char(b: u8) -> bool` that are called in hot
loops, `#[inline(always)]` tells the compiler to inline the function body at every call
site. This eliminates function-call overhead (register push/pop, jump) and lets the
compiler optimize the inlined code within the loop context — e.g., keeping the byte value
in a register instead of passing it on the stack. Without the hint, the compiler might
not inline across module boundaries.

**Custom `BufRead`-based WARC parser — selective parsing**
The `warc` crate (v0.4) parses ALL headers with `nom` and allocates a `HashMap` per
record. Our custom `WarcRecordIter` reads headers line-by-line and only extracts
`WARC-Type` and `Content-Length` — everything else is ignored with zero allocation. For
non-response records (request, metadata, warcinfo — ~60% of all records), the body is
skipped entirely by reading and discarding `content_length` bytes through a stack buffer.
This means ~60% of the decompressed data is never read into heap memory.

**`memmap2::Mmap` — memory-mapped file I/O**
Memory mapping makes the OS map a file's contents directly into the process's virtual
address space. Instead of explicit `read()` syscalls, data access happens through page
faults handled by the kernel's virtual memory system. Benefits: zero-copy body slices
(`&[u8]` into the mapped region, no `Vec<u8>` allocation), efficient page cache usage,
and no read syscalls. The trade-off: gzip is a streaming format, so we must decompress
the entire archive to a temporary file first, then mmap that. This costs disk space
(~3-5x the compressed size) but enables the zero-copy parsing.

**`unsafe` blocks — controlled unsafety for `mmap`**
`memmap2::Mmap::map()` requires an `unsafe` block because the OS could theoretically
modify the mapped file while we're reading it (another process could write to it),
causing undefined behavior. We document why our usage is safe: we created the temp file
and no other process modifies it. `unsafe` doesn't mean "dangerous" — it means "the
programmer is responsible for upholding invariants the compiler can't verify." Keeping
`unsafe` blocks small and well-documented is idiomatic Rust.

**`WarcSliceIter` — zero-copy parsing on contiguous slices**
When data is in a contiguous `&[u8]` (from mmap), we can use a different parser that
returns `&[u8]` body slices instead of owned `Vec<u8>`. This is zero-copy: the body
bytes stay in the OS page cache and are never copied to the heap. The slice parser also
uses `memmem` to find `\r\n\r\n` header boundaries (faster than line-by-line reading on
contiguous data). This is only possible when the entire decompressed content is available
at once — the streaming parser can't do this because buffers get reused.

**`flate2` with `zlib-ng` — SIMD-optimized decompression**
The default `flate2` backend is `miniz_oxide` (pure Rust). Switching to `zlib-ng` — a
heavily SIMD-optimized C library for inflate — gave a significant decompression speedup.
Since gzip decompression is the bottleneck for all strategies (not the search), this
benefits every strategy equally:

```toml
flate2 = { version = "1", features = ["zlib-ng"], default-features = false }
```

This links against zlib-ng built from source via `cmake`. It requires a C compiler and
cmake on the build machine, which is a trade-off for portability. The `libflate` crate
is kept for paths-file decompression (small files where performance doesn't matter).

**`clap::ValueEnum` — type-safe enum CLI arguments**
`#[derive(ValueEnum)]` on the `Strategy` enum lets `clap` parse strategy names directly
from the CLI (`--strategy memchr`). The derive macro auto-generates the list of valid
values for `--help` and provides compile-time exhaustive matching in the dispatch code.
Doc comments on enum variants become the help text for each option.

**Manual ASCII digit parsing — avoiding hidden costs**
`Content-Length` values in WARC headers are always ASCII digits. `parse_ascii_usize()`
converts them to `usize` with a direct arithmetic loop instead of `str::parse::<usize>()`.
This avoids: (1) UTF-8 validation (we know it's ASCII), (2) error type construction
(we return 0 for malformed input), (3) generic trait dispatch. For a hot path called
hundreds of thousands of times per archive, these micro-optimizations compound.

### Architecture: why four strategies, not just the fastest?

This is a teaching project. Having all four strategies in the same binary lets you:
1. **Benchmark each optimization in isolation** — run the same archive with `-s baseline`
   then `-s memchr` and compare timing directly
2. **Understand what each technique buys** — the speedup from `baseline` to `bytes` is
   purely about avoiding UTF-8 conversion; from `bytes` to `memchr` is about replacing
   regex with SIMD literals
3. **See the trade-offs** — `mmap` is theoretically fastest but needs 3-5x disk space
   for the temp file and requires `unsafe`; `memchr` is nearly as fast with no downsides

Runtime selection via CLI flag (not cargo features) means you build once and benchmark
all four strategies without recompiling. The binary size cost of including all four is
negligible.

### Dependencies added

- **`memchr`**: SIMD-accelerated byte/substring search — the engine behind ripgrep's
  literal optimization. Provides `memmem::Finder` for searching byte slices.
- **`memmap2`**: Memory-mapped file I/O. Maps files into virtual memory for zero-copy
  access via `&[u8]` slices.
- **`flate2`** (with `zlib-ng`): Gzip decompression wrapping the SIMD-optimized zlib-ng
  C library. Replaces `libflate` for the custom parser's decompression path.

## Step 8: WARC Metadata Extraction

### What we built

Rich source context for every `.onion` address found. Previously, each onion mapped to
a list of archive filenames (just "which WARC file"). Now each onion maps to a list of
`OnionSource` structs containing three fields:

- **`url`** — the clearnet page URL where the onion address appeared (from `WARC-Target-URI`)
- **`date`** — when Common Crawl fetched that page (from `WARC-Date`)
- **`archive`** — which WARC archive file contained the record

This answers not just "which archive" but "which specific page, and when was it crawled?"
— much more useful for analysis. The output format changed from flat to nested JSON:

```json
{
  "example1234567890.onion": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/links",
      "date": "2024-09-15T12:34:56Z",
      "archive": "CC-NEWS-20240915.warc.gz"
    }
  ]
}
```

Results are deduplicated on `(url, archive)` pairs — the same onion found on the same
page in the same archive is recorded only once.

### Rust concepts introduced

**`#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` — serde derive macros**
The `serde` crate provides Rust's standard serialization framework. Adding
`#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` to a struct auto-generates all the code needed to
convert it to/from any supported format (JSON, TOML, YAML, etc.) at compile time. The
struct field names become the JSON keys directly. This is zero-cost at runtime — the
generated code is as efficient as hand-written serialization. We use `Serialize` in
`save_results()` (struct → JSON) and `Deserialize` in `load_results()` (JSON → struct).

**`serde` — serialize + deserialize framework**
`serde` itself is format-agnostic — it defines the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits
that describe how a type converts to/from an abstract data model. The actual format
encoding comes from companion crates like `serde_json`. This separation means the same
`#[derive(Serialize)]` works for JSON, TOML, MessagePack, etc. without changing the
struct. Previously we didn't need derive macros because `HashMap<String, Vec<String>>`
has blanket `Serialize` implementations — but custom structs like `OnionSource` need
the derive.

**Backwards-compatible deserialization with `unwrap_or_default`**
When the output format changes (from `HashMap<String, Vec<String>>` to
`HashMap<String, Vec<OnionSource>>`), old JSON files won't parse into the new type.
Instead of crashing, `load_results()` uses `serde_json::from_str(&content).unwrap_or_default()`,
which falls back to an empty `HashMap` if deserialization fails. This is a practical
pattern for evolving data formats: the first run after the format change reprocesses
archives (since their onions aren't in the new results), and old results are silently
replaced rather than causing errors.

**Extracting WARC headers from the custom parser**
The custom `WarcRecordIter` (streaming) and `WarcSliceIter` (mmap) were extended to
extract `WARC-Target-URI` and `WARC-Date` headers alongside the existing `WARC-Type`
and `Content-Length`. The streaming parser stores them as owned `String` fields in
`WarcRecord`; the slice parser stores them as borrowed `&[u8]` slices in `WarcSlice`
(zero-copy from the mmap region). The baseline strategy reads the same headers from
the `warc` crate via `record.header(warc::WarcHeader::TargetURI)`.

**`Clone` derive for shared references in search functions**
`OnionSource` derives `Clone` because the same source metadata may be referenced
multiple times when a single WARC record body contains multiple distinct onion
addresses. Each match gets its own copy of the source. For small structs (three
`String` fields), cloning is cheap — the alternative (wrapping in `Rc` or `Arc`)
would add complexity for negligible benefit.

### What's next

with onion addresses across crawl dates.
